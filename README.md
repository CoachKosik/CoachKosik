# Hello, I'm Justin

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m transitioning into cybersecurity with a focus on **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** after 20+ years in high-level leadership roles in education and athletics. My background in strategic planning, documentation, time management, process discipline, and team development aligns directly with identity governance, access control, and authentication workflows.

I hold the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** and **AI Essentials**, and I'm currently preparing for **Microsoft SC-900**, **Okta Certified Professional**, and **CompTIA Security+**. My GitHub showcases hands-on labs across IAM, Linux permissions, network analysis, SIEM fundamentals, Python automation, and threat modeling.

My career goal is to become an IAM engineer specializing in **identity lifecycle management, RBAC, MFA, and secure authentication for modern enterprise environments**.
