Recently changing careers in high level leadership and management at the college and high school levels in athletics and education to cybersecurity.  My background in leadership and strategic planning has equipped me to tackle complex challenges.  My interest for the field of cybersecurity, fueled by a desire to make a difference in the digital world, backed by my recent Google Cybersecurity and AI Essentials certifications demonstrate my commitment to this field, and I'm actively pursuing the CompTIA Security+ certification to further my knowledge.


Fueled by a passion for technology and a strong foundation in leadership, I'm transitioning into cybersecurity.  My recent Google Cybersecurity and AI Essentials certifications, coupled with my ongoing pursuit of the CompTIA Security+, demonstrate my commitment to this field.  My ultimate goal is to specialize in Identity and Access Management (IAM), leveraging my analytical and problem-solving skills to safeguard critical systems.
