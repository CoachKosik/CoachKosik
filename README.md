# 👋 Hi, I'm Justin  
### Identity & Access Management (IAM) | Entra ID | Zero Trust | MFA | Lifecycle Governance  

I specialize in **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**, with hands-on projects in Entra ID (Azure AD), MFA enforcement, Conditional Access, and full Joiner–Mover–Leaver lifecycle governance. My background includes 20+ years leading teams with operational discipline — a direct match for modern identity governance and access control work.

I hold the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** + **Google AI Essentials**, and I'm actively preparing for **Microsoft SC-900**, **Okta Certified Professional**, and **Security+**.

# 🚀 IAM Portfolio (Flagship Projects)

These are my **four enterprise-grade IAM projects**, built with full documentation and screenshot evidence.

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **🔐 [Project 1 — Identity Basics Lab](https://github.com/CoachKosik/Project-1-Microsoft-Entra-ID-Identity-Basics-Lab)** | Built a clean identity baseline with users, security groups, RBAC, and least-privilege directory structure. |
| **🛡️ [Project 2 — Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://github.com/CoachKosik/Project-2-Enforce-Multi-Factor-Authentication-MFA)** | Enforced MFA using Conditional Access + Authentication Method Policies. Full sign-in testing & audit evidence. |
| **🔄 [Project 3 — Identity Lifecycle (JML)](https://github.com/CoachKosik/Project-3-Microsoft-Entra-ID-Identity-Lifecycle-JML)** | Full Joiner → Mover → Leaver lifecycle including department transitions, app provisioning, and termination governance. |
| **🌐 [Project 4 — Zero Trust Conditional Access](https://github.com/CoachKosik/Project-4-Entra-ID-Conditional-Access-Zero-Trust)** | Zero Trust policy stack: MFA, Named Locations, Legacy Auth Blocking, Break-Glass, and Admin/AllUsers segmentation. |
